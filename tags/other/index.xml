Genetic variant interpretation is an evolving process dependent on the collective evidence at that moment of time. Also, it is based on the pipeline and expertise used in each laboratory despite the adoption of ACMG guidelines for sequence variant interpretation and centralized resources such as ClinVar. Thus, there is discordance in variant interpretation between laboratories. Health providers (HP) are challenged when counseling patients post risk-reducing surgery with a genetic variant downgraded from likely pathogenic to variant uncertain significance, benign or likely benign.</description>
