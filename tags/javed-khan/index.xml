Background: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extra-cranial solid cancer in children. Although multimodal therapies with differentiating agents and immunotherapy with anti-GD2 antibody and GM-CSF have shown promising results, it remains deadly in approximately 50% of patients with high-risk disease. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies (CAR-T) have been found to be effective in treating refractory and relapsed leukemia and lymphoma, and two of them have been recently approved by the FDA.</description>

      <title>Combined Immunogenomic and Immunopeptidomic Analyses Identified Biologically Relevant Immune Signatures and Novel Immunotherapy Targets in Osteosarcoma</title>

Background: Osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone tumor that is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the pediatric population. Several phase I clinical trials have reported occasional clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors in osteosarcoma patients. The key feature of immunotherapy involves T cell recognition of peptides from abnormal proteins (tumor-associated antigens; TAAs) presented by MHC class I of tumor cells which stimulates specific anti-tumor cytotoxicity.</description>

      <title>Identification of a First-in-Class KDM3B Inhibitor That Suppresses PAX3-FOXO1 Oncogene Activity in Fusion Positive Rhabdomyosarcoma</title>

BACKGROUND: The PAX3/7-FOXO1 fusion gene is the major oncogenic driver in fusion positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS), which is a highly aggressive soft tissue muscle sarcoma of childhood. The chimeric gene results from either t(2;13) or t(1;13) translocation and has been shown by our group to drive FP-RMS oncogenesis through transcription activation driven by super enhancers.</description>
